# Weekly Review Protocol

Comprehensive review of the past week and planning for the next.

## Step 1: Read Past Week's Data

Read from `/Users/khasim/Library/Containers/nl.t-shaped.Sushitrain/Data/Documents/logseq-full/`:

1. **Journals**: Last 7 days from `journals/` folder
2. `pages/Goals.md` - Current goals
3. `pages/Projects.md` - Active projects
4. `pages/Patterns.md` - Previous metrics
5. `pages/Habits.md` - Habit targets
6. `pages/The Way.md` - Values reference

## Step 2: Calculate Metrics

Count from journal entries:

### Productivity
- **ONE Things Completed**: Count completed ONE Thing tasks
- **ONE Things Planned**: Should be 5-7 (one per day)
- **Tasks Completed**: Total DONE tasks
- **Tasks Created**: Total new tasks added
- **Deep Work Sessions**: Count morning work blocks (estimate hours)

### Health
- **Exercise Sessions**: Count workout mentions (target: 3)
- **Sleep Quality**: Note any sleep issues mentioned
- **Energy Notes**: Any energy patterns observed

### Faith
- **Prayer Consistency**: Check prayer tracker entries
- **Quran Days**: Count days with Quran reading
- **Fajr On Time**: Count successful early mornings

### Family
- **Family Time Hours**: Estimate from journal entries
- **Family Events**: Count outings, activities mentioned

### Work
- **Total Work Hours**: Estimate from journal entries
- **Worked Past 9pm**: Count late night work mentions
- **Weekend Work**: Any work on Sat/Sun?

## Step 3: Analyze Projects

For each active project:
- What got done this week?
- What's the next milestone?
- Are we on track?
- Any blockers?

## Step 4: Compare to Values (The Way)

Calculate time allocation by value:
- Imaan: X hours (prayers, Quran, learning)
- Health: X hours (exercise, rest)
- Family: X hours (kids, spouse, family time)
- Time: Was time protected or wasted?
- Money/Career: X hours (work, business)

Flag if any top value is being neglected.

## Step 5: Detect Patterns

### Overcommitting Signals
- [ ] Daily hours > 6 regularly
- [ ] Working past 9pm > 2 days
- [ ] Exercise sessions < target
- [ ] No family events
- [ ] Weekend work

### Slacking Signals
- [ ] ONE Thing not done 3+ days
- [ ] Same tasks carrying over
- [ ] Inbox growing
- [ ] Deep work < 10 hours/week
- [ ] No project progress

## Step 6: Generate Review Output
