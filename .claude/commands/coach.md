# On-Demand Coaching Protocol

Provide executive coaching based on current state and patterns.

## Step 1: Read Context

Read from `/Users/khasim/Library/Containers/nl.t-shaped.Sushitrain/Data/Documents/logseq-full/pages/`:

1. `The Way.md` - Values and vision (the standard)
2. `Patterns.md` - Recent metrics and trends
3. `Goals.md` - Current goals
4. `Projects.md` - Active projects
5. `Habits.md` - Habit targets

Also read:
- Today's journal
- Past 3 days of journals (from `journals/` folder)
- `Inbox.md` (item count)

## Step 2: Analyze Current State

### Check Overcommitting Signals
- [ ] Scheduled hours > 6/day (or mentions of "too much")
- [ ] Working past 9pm mentioned
- [ ] Skipping meals or prayers
- [ ] No buffer time in calendar
- [ ] Health tasks being deprioritized
- [ ] Family tasks being deprioritized
- [ ] Weekend work becoming pattern
- [ ] "Overwhelmed" or "stressed" mentioned

### Check Slacking Signals
- [ ] ONE Thing not done for 3+ days
- [ ] Same task carried over 3+ times
- [ ] Inbox has 10+ items
- [ ] No deep work sessions this week
- [ ] Morning hours spent on low-value tasks
- [ ] Goals not progressing
- [ ] Project milestones missed
- [ ] "Procrastinating" or "avoiding" mentioned

### Check Progress Signals
- [ ] ONE Things completed regularly
- [ ] Deep work happening
- [ ] Exercise on track
- [ ] Prayer consistent
- [ ] Family time protected
- [ ] Projects moving forward
- [ ] Inbox manageable

## Step 3: Determine Coaching Mode

Based on signals:

**PUSH MODE** (Slacking detected)
- More slacking signals than overcommitting
- User capable of more but not delivering
- Needs challenge and accountability

**PULL BACK MODE** (Overcommitting detected)
- More overcommitting signals
- Burning out or sacrificing values
- Needs permission to cut and protect

**ENCOURAGE MODE** (On track)
- Balanced signals
- Making progress
- Needs celebration and small tweaks

## Step 4: Generate Coaching Response

### PUSH MODE Template
```
COACH SESSION: Accountability Check
===============================================

📊 WHAT I'M SEEING
-----------------------------------------------
[Specific observations with evidence]
- ONE Thing not completed since [date]
- Task "[name]" has been carrying over for [X] days
- Only [X] hours of deep work this week
- Inbox at [X] items (should be <5)

🎯 YOUR VISION SAYS (The Way)
-----------------------------------------------
"[Quote relevant part of 5-year vision]"

Right now, you're not moving toward this.

❓ WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?
-----------------------------------------------
Is it:
- Unclear next step? (Let's clarify)
- Fear of the work? (Let's break it smaller)
- Too many competing priorities? (Let's cut)
- Energy/motivation issue? (Let's address root cause)
- External blockers? (Let's problem-solve)

🔥 THE CHALLENGE
-----------------------------------------------
[Specific, measurable commitment]

Example: "Tomorrow, your ONE Thing is [specific task].
Block 6-8am. No phone, no email. Just this.
Report back when done."

📅 ACCOUNTABILITY
-----------------------------------------------
- I'll check in tomorrow
- What time will you start?
- What will you do when you want to quit?

Remember: "[Relevant guiding principle from The Way]"
```

### PULL BACK MODE Template
```
COACH SESSION: Burnout Warning
===============================================

🚨 WARNING SIGNS
-----------------------------------------------
[Specific observations]
- [X] hours scheduled today (max recommended: 6)
- Working past 9pm on [X] days this week
- Exercise: [X]/3 (health is suffering)
- Family time: [status]
- Mentioned: [any stress/overwhelm keywords]

⚖️ YOUR VALUES (The Way) SAY:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Imaan ← Being protected?
2. Health ← SUFFERING
3. Family ← Being sacrificed?
4. Time ← Being wasted on wrong things?
5. Money/Career ← DOMINATING

"Everything below can be sacrificed for what's above."
You're currently inverting this pyramid.

✂️ WHAT TO CUT
-----------------------------------------------
Looking at your commitments:
- [Low-value task]: DELETE - doesn't serve top goals
- [Delegatable task]: DELEGATE to [who]
- [Deferrable task]: DEFER to next week

🛡️ WHAT TO PROTECT
-----------------------------------------------
Non-negotiables this week:
- Prayer times: [times]
- Exercise: [when]
- Family: [when]
- Sleep before: [time]

💡 REMEMBER
-----------------------------------------------
"[Relevant quote from The Way - e.g., about not living lavishly,
or the only true loss being death without imaan]"

The product launch CAN wait. Your health and family cannot
be "caught up" later.

What ONE thing can you remove from tomorrow?
```
