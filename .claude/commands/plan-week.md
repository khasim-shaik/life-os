# Weekly Planning Protocol

Plan the upcoming week (best done Sunday evening or Monday morning).

## Step 1: Read Context

Read from `/Users/khasim/Library/Containers/nl.t-shaped.Sushitrain/Data/Documents/logseq-full/pages/`:

1. `The Way.md` - Vision and values
2. `Goals.md` - Current goals and milestones
3. `Projects.md` - Active projects and deadlines
4. `Habits.md` - Weekly habit targets
5. `Patterns.md` - Last week's data (if /review was run)

## Step 2: Check Calendar (via Google Calendar MCP)

Use google-calendar MCP to:
- Get events for next 7 days
- Identify fixed commitments
- Calculate available time
- Note any busy days

## Step 3: Identify Key Outcomes

Based on goals and project milestones, identify 3-5 key outcomes:

### Questions to Ask:
- What project milestone is due or should be hit?
- What goal needs attention this week?
- What's been neglected that needs focus?
- What would make this week a success?

### Outcome Criteria:
- Specific and measurable
- Achievable in one week
- Connected to a goal or project
- Aligned with values

## Step 4: Calculate Capacity

### Fixed Time (subtract from available):
- Prayer times: 5 × 15 min × 7 days = ~9 hours
- Sleep: 7-8 hours × 7 = ~52 hours
- Work (if employed): [X] hours
- Family commitments: [X] hours
- Existing calendar events: [X] hours

### Available Deep Work:
- Early mornings (5-8am): Up to 21 hours potential
- Realistic: 10-15 hours deep work

### Capacity Check:
- If outcomes require > 20 hours: TOO MUCH
- If outcomes require < 5 hours: TOO LITTLE
- Sweet spot: 10-15 hours of meaningful work

## Step 5: Plan Daily ONE Things

Assign one major task per day:

### Monday
- ONE Thing: [Task] → supports [[Project/Goal]]
- Time: [When]

### Tuesday
- ONE Thing: [Task] → supports [[Project/Goal]]
- Time: [When]

### Wednesday
- ONE Thing: [Task] → supports [[Project/Goal]]
- Time: [When]

### Thursday
- ONE Thing: [Task] → supports [[Project/Goal]]
- Time: [When]

### Friday
- ONE Thing: [Task] → supports [[Project/Goal]]
- Time: [When]

### Saturday/Sunday
- Family time priority
- ONE Thing only if energy permits

## Step 6: Generate Week Plan

```
WEEK PLAN: [Date Range]
===============================================

🎯 KEY OUTCOMES (3-5)
-----------------------------------------------
1. [Outcome] → supports [[Goal/Project]]
2. [Outcome] → supports [[Goal/Project]]
3. [Outcome] → supports [[Goal/Project]]

📅 DAILY ONE THINGS
-----------------------------------------------
Mon: [Task] - [Time block]
Tue: [Task] - [Time block]
Wed: [Task] - [Time block]
Thu: [Task] - [Time block]
Fri: [Task] - [Time block]
Sat: [Family/Rest]
Sun: [Family/Rest/Weekly Review]

⏰ TIME BLOCKS TO CREATE
-----------------------------------------------
- [Day] [Time]: [Activity]
- [Day] [Time]: [Activity]
- [Day] [Time]: [Activity]

🔒 PROTECT THESE (Non-Negotiables)
-----------------------------------------------
- Prayer times: [List or "already blocked"]
- Family time: [When]
- Exercise: Mon/Wed/Fri [Time]
- Deep work: Daily 5-8am

📊 CAPACITY CHECK
-----------------------------------------------
Available hours: ~[X]
Planned hours: ~[X]
Buffer: [X] hours

[✓ Looks good / ⚠️ Overcommitted - consider cutting]

🎯 HABITS TO TRACK
-----------------------------------------------
- Exercise: 3 sessions (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- Quran: Daily after Fajr
- Deep work: 5 sessions minimum
- Family outing: [Day]

💡 FOCUS NOTE

This week's theme: [One sentence focus]

===============================================
```

## Step 7: Offer Actions

- "Would you like me to create these time blocks on your calendar?"
- "Should I add these ONE Things to each day's journal?"
- "Want me to set up habit tracking reminders?"

## Capacity Rules

### Red Flags (Overcommitted):
- More than 6 hours scheduled on any day
- No buffer time between blocks
- Weekend fully scheduled
- Every slot filled

### Green Flags (Balanced):
- 4-6 hours deep work per day max
- 30+ min buffer between major blocks
- At least one weekend day unscheduled
- Family time explicitly protected
- Prayer times never double-booked

### Adjustments:
If overcommitted, ask:
- "Which outcome is lowest priority?"
- "What can be deferred to next week?"
- "What can be delegated?"
