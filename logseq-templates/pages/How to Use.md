- ## The 3 Rules
  - **Rule 1**: Capture fast, organize later
  - **Rule 2**: One place for thoughts (Inbox), one place for today (Journal)
  - **Rule 3**: If it takes more than 5 seconds, you're overcomplicating it

- ## Daily Workflow (5 minutes total)

- ### Morning (2 min)
  - Open today's journal
  - Type `/template` → select `daily`
  - Replace "Task 1" with your ONE most important thing
  - Add 2-3 more tasks (or skip if your day is reactive)
  - Done. Start working.

- ### During the Day (10 seconds each)
  - **Thought pops up?** → Open [[Inbox]], type it, close
  - **Task done?** → Tap the checkbox (TODO → DONE)
  - **New task?** → Add to today's journal: `- TODO thing [[Project]]`
  - **Big idea?** → Dump in [[Inbox]], process tonight

- ### Evening (2 min, optional)
  - Glance at journal → note what got done
  - Check [[Inbox]] → move items to proper pages or tomorrow
  - That's it. Close the app.

- ## Real World Scenarios

- ### Scenario 1: Random thought while commuting
  **Situation**: You're on the train and remember you need to renew car insurance.

  **Do this**:
  - Open Logseq → [[Inbox]]
  - Type: `renew car insurance`
  - Close app

  **Time**: 5 seconds

  **Later** (evening): Move to [[Finances]] or tomorrow's journal with `- TODO Renew car insurance [[Finances]]`

- ### Scenario 2: Boss assigns urgent task in meeting
  **Situation**: You're in a meeting and get assigned to review a proposal by Friday.

  **Do this**:
  - Open today's journal
  - Add: `- TODO Review proposal by Friday [[Career]]`
  - Keep listening to meeting

  **Time**: 8 seconds

- ### Scenario 3: Starting your morning
  **Situation**: It's 6am, you have coffee, want to plan the day.

  **Do this**:
  - Open today's journal (empty)
  - Type `/template` → `daily`
  - Look at your [[Goals]] page (what matters this quarter?)
  - Pick ONE thing that moves the needle
  - Add 2-3 supporting tasks
  - Start working on the ONE thing

  **Time**: 2 minutes

  **Example result**:
  ```
  ## 🎯 ONE Thing
    - TODO Ship login feature [[MVP Launch]]

  ## 📋 Tasks
    - TODO Reply to investor email [[Career]]
    - TODO Book dentist appointment [[Health]]
    - TODO Review kids school form [[Family]]
  ```

- ### Scenario 4: Overwhelmed with too many things
  **Situation**: Your brain is full, you feel anxious, too many tabs open in your head.

  **Do this**:
  - Open [[Inbox]]
  - Brain dump EVERYTHING (no formatting, no thinking, just type)
  - One item per line
  - Keep going until your head is empty
  - Close the app
  - Feel relief

  **Time**: 3-5 minutes

  **Later** (when calm): Process inbox, move items to projects or delete

- ### Scenario 5: Weekly planning (Sunday evening)
  **Situation**: Want to set up the week ahead.

  **Do this**:
  - Open today's journal
  - Type `/template` → `weekly-review`
  - Review last week: What worked? What didn't?
  - Check [[Goals]] and [[Projects]]
  - Identify 3-5 key outcomes for the week
  - Done

  **Time**: 10 minutes

- ## Power User Tips

- ### Quick Capture Shortcuts
  - `- TODO ` starts a task
  - `[[` opens page linking (autocomplete shows existing pages)
  - `/template` inserts templates
  - `DONE` or checkbox marks complete

- ### Link Everything to Projects
  - Bad: `- TODO Fix the bug`
  - Good: `- TODO Fix the bug [[MVP Launch]]`
  - Why: Claude can find all tasks for a project, you can see related work

- ### Use Inbox as RAM, Journal as Today
  - **Inbox** = temporary holding, brain dump, random thoughts
  - **Journal** = today's commitments, what you're actually doing
  - Never let Inbox grow beyond 10 items (process daily)

- ### The 2-Minute Rule
  - If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it now
  - Don't write it down, just do it
  - Only capture things that need tracking

- ### Don't Over-Organize
  - You don't need folders
  - You don't need tags (project links are enough)
  - You don't need priorities (your ONE thing is the priority)
  - Keep it flat, keep it simple

- ## What NOT to Do

- ### Don't
  - Spend 20 minutes "setting up" your day
  - Create complex hierarchies and nested projects
  - Feel guilty about an empty journal
  - Track everything (Streaks handles habits)
  - Use this for reference material (use Google Drive/Notion for that)

- ### Do
  - Capture fast, think later
  - Trust the system (it's searchable)
  - Keep Inbox clean
  - Focus on ONE thing per day
  - Let Claude do the heavy lifting (morning briefing)

- ## The Mental Model

  ```
  Your Brain → Quick Capture → Inbox
                                 ↓
                          Process (evening)
                                 ↓
              ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
              ↓                 ↓                 ↓
          Delete          Tomorrow's         Project Page
        (not important)     Journal          (for later)
  ```

  **Your job**: Capture and do.
  **System's job**: Remember and organize.
  **Claude's job**: Analyze and prioritize.

- ## Summary

  | Action | Where | Time |
  |--------|-------|------|
  | Random thought | [[Inbox]] | 5 sec |
  | Today's task | Journal | 8 sec |
  | Plan the day | Journal + `/template` | 2 min |
  | Brain dump | [[Inbox]] | 3 min |
  | Weekly review | Journal + `/template` | 10 min |
  | Process inbox | [[Inbox]] → Projects | 5 min |

  **Total daily overhead: 5-10 minutes**

  Everything else is just doing the work.
