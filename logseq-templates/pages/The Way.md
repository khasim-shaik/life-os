- ## My Life in 5 Years: A Life of Purpose, Power, and Asymmetry
  By the will and permission of Allah, five years from now:

- ### Business & Work
  - I am the owner of a SaaS company that sells impactful digital products
  - These products are widely used and provide valuable solutions to real business problems
  - I am expert at building products from scratch OR acquiring them and adding value, selling for profit
  - 90% of the stuff I do everyday gives me energy
  - I am very efficient at using my time
  - I operate three profitable Shopify stores generating consistent income across various niches
  - These businesses run smoothly and provide reliable financial security
  - I am an investor and builder of business ecosystems
  - I allocate capital into ventures that matter
  - All of my businesses follow a systems-first model
  - They run without my constant involvement
  - I work no more than 8 hours a day

- ### Financial Freedom
  - I am free - I no longer rely on a full-time job
  - I live off $10,000/month income from my businesses
  - First 10k/month is reinvested in the business
  - Anything excess is profit for living
  - My entire family is supported by this
  - We do not live lavishly - we live intentionally
  - Excess wealth is reinvested to build lasting value for the ummah

- ### Family Life
  - I spend 6 hours each day with my wife, children, and family
  - I have time to be present, to lead, to love, and to nurture
  - The remaining hours are for worship, learning, and rest
  - I take the entire month of Ramadan off
  - It is a sacred time devoted to worship, reflection, and teaching my children
  - My home is filled with remembrance of Allah during this month

- ### Fatherhood
  - I am a deeply engaged father
  - When a man dies nothing benefits him more than pious children and good deeds that continue to live
  - My children are my greatest investment
  - They are pious, grounded, and prepared to lead
  - I teach them to live with purpose in a world filled with distraction and fitnah

- ### Marriage
  - I am a great husband
  - I love my wife and express it well
  - I make her feel loved and comfortable
  - I support my wife in unlocking her potential
  - Her goals are valued
  - Her success is celebrated

- ### Freedom & Travel
  - I have full travel freedom
  - I am not bound by visa restrictions
  - I can go wherever my presence is needed

- ### Spiritual Growth
  - Spiritually, I am at a high rank
  - I have memorized the last 10 chapters of the Qur'an
  - I understand Qur'anic Arabic
  - I recite with meaning
  - My connection to Allah is strong

- ### Brotherhood
  - I am surrounded by strong Muslim men
  - Brothers, advisors, and friends who uplift me
  - I am part of a tight circle of believers who strive together and hold each other to account

- ## Core Values (Strict Priority Order)
  Rule: Everything below can be sacrificed to protect what is above.
  My decisions are based on this priority.

  - ### 1. Imaan (Faith)
    priority:: 6
    sacrifice-for:: nothing
    description:: Foundation of everything. The only true loss is death without imaan.

  - ### 2. Health
    priority:: 5
    sacrifice-for:: Imaan only
    description:: Energy to fulfill all responsibilities. Without health, nothing else matters.

  - ### 3. Family
    priority:: 4
    sacrifice-for:: Imaan, Health
    description:: Present father and husband. Children are my greatest investment.

  - ### 4. Time
    priority:: 3
    sacrifice-for:: Imaan, Health, Family
    description:: Most precious non-renewable resource. Guard it fiercely.

  - ### 5. Money
    priority:: 2
    sacrifice-for:: Above four
    description:: A tool, not a goal. Enables freedom and impact.

  - ### 6. Friends
    priority:: 1
    sacrifice-for:: Above five
    description:: Brotherhood matters, but not at the expense of the above.

- ## Guiding Principles

  - ### Asymmetric Thinking
    - I play asymmetric games - always focused on the upside
    - Always thinking: "What if this works? What could it unlock?"
    - I seek asymmetrical returns - small inputs, outsized outcomes
    - I am not afraid of loss - the only true loss is death without imaan

  - ### Atomic Habits
    - Small daily improvements compound into massive results
    - Systems over goals
    - Identity-based habits: "I am someone who..."

  - ### Energy Management
    - 90% of work should give me energy
    - Eliminate or delegate what drains
    - Protect peak hours (early morning) for deep work
    - Know when to rest

  - ### Intentional Living
    - I live simply
    - I do not care about luxury cars, mansions, or fancy vacations
    - Live intentionally, not lavishly
    - Excess wealth reinvested for the ummah

  - ### Business Philosophy
    - First 10k/month reinvested in business
    - Systems-first: businesses run without constant involvement
    - Build or acquire, add value, profit
    - Work no more than 8 hours a day
